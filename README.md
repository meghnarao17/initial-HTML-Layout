PG County Spending Amount by Agency

API: The API I chose to use was the PG County Spending Information which essentially tracked the agencies PG county
     gave their money to and how often these agencies recieved money
https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/2qma-7ez9.json

Visualizations: Using Chart.JS, I created a donut chart which displayed the agencies and frequency of payments made to those agencies

Problem: This project intended to determine which agencies PG county put majority of their money into. By determining which agency most money went to, inferences and reccomendations could be made to improve the crime rate and environmental situation of PG county. This also allowed for comparison of PG county to other counties in Maryland.
